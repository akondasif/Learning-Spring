Core Spring - learning made easy
=================================

Sample code snippet for getting started (gs) with Core Spring.


Skip steps of creating new project, instead use this project directly for quick start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Prerequisites for this project setup
	- Java 7
	- Maven
	- Spring Tool Suite (STS) / Eclipse (preferably with Spring plugins installed)
* Just import project in STS and switch to Spring perspective. 
* Fix build path errors, such as JRE configuration. That's it.

* Run "App.java" files in different packages, which contain main() method as a start point of demo code in each packages. Refer corresponding Spring configuration and play with the code to learn.
